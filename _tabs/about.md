# Hi, welcome to my blog!

I am Jiang Haoyu, and I am interested in computer graphics. Except what I learned from class and online, Unfortunately, I haven't had more chances to delve deeper into this field yet.
Besides, I have recently started getting into photography. It's kind of like rendering for God's models.
Here, on my blog, I would like to share some of the things I've learned. Hope you like it.
